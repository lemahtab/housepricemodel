# House Prices Prediction
A linear regression model to predict house prices (MAE = 16.66% of mean)

Source of dataset: I use the dataset I found in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-for-financial-analysis-financial-modeling/).

Problem: To predict house prices given details such as number of rooms, distance from employment hubs, connectivity, air quality, etc.

Solution: I built a multivariate linear regression model to predict house prices in this project. My model predicts house prices (on test dataset) with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 16.66% of mean. It means that, on average, my predictions of house prices deviate from the real prices by 16.66%.
